Written using typescript/angular2/node.js  

Very early stage. v0.1 
You can run using `npm run go` (it starts the gulp - browsersync and nodemon, and tsc which watches for file changes). You should also run tsc in public/app in another cmd/terminal
or you can transpile .ts files in / and public/app and just do `node app.js`

##Goal
Simple. Have a fully reactive, modern, and easy-to use shitposting place (reddit/4chan -like) where people can see updates and changes in real time (or close to real time).
