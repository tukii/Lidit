# Lidit
__Live__ image board / reddit style website  

Written using typescript/angular2/node.js  

Very early stage. (<0.1)
run using `npm run go` (it starts the gulp - browsersync and nodemon, and tsc and watches for file changes)

##Goal
Simple. Have a fully reactive, modern, and easy-to use shitposting place (reddit/4chan -like) where people can see updates and changes in real time (or close to real time).

##Ideas
Im thinking about not having pages, but rather loading new content as the user scrolls down.  
Auto expand posts on mouse over? Need to think this through.  
Should i prevent users from having personal "sublids" and just stick to ones i add?  
Have multiple sublids open at one time side by side? Or just give an option to show multiple combined?
